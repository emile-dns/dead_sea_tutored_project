	abstract = {The Siling Co Lake is the largest endorheic lake in Central Tibet. Altimetric measures, combined with lake contours, show that in 1972–1999 its water level remained stable, while it increased by about 1.0 m/yr in the period 2000–2006. The increased rate gradually stepped down to 0.2 m/yr in 2007–2011. The ground motion associated with the water load increase is studied by interferometric synthetic aperture radar ({InSAR}) using 107 {ERS} and Envisat {SAR} images during the period 1992–2011. The deformation amplitude closely follows the lake level temporal evolution, except that subsidence continues in 2008–2011, while the lake level stagnated. This temporal evolution suggests a non elastic relaxation process taking place at a decade timescale. Phase delay maps are used to constrain possible layered viscoelastic rheological models. An elastic model could partly explain the observed subsidence rate if elastic moduli are about twice lower than those extracted from {VP}/{VS} profiles. The surface deformation pattern is also extracted by projecting the phase delay maps against the best fit model temporal behavior. It shows that deep relaxation in the asthenosphere is negligible at the decade timescale and favors the existence of a ductile channel in the deep crust above a more rigid mantle. Overall, the best fit model includes a ductile lower crust, with a viscosity of 1–3 × 1018 Pa s between 25 and 35 km and the Moho (at 65 km), overlying a rigid mantle.},

	abstract = {The Dead Sea basin is located along the left-lateral transform boundary between the Arabian and Sinai plates. Its structure and history are known from surface geology, drilling, seismic reflection and other geophysical data. The basin comprises a large pull-apart, almost 150 km long and mostly 8–10 km wide, which is flanked by a few kilometres wide zones of normal faulting. The basin formed at about 15 Ma or earlier, close to the beginning of the transform motion, and it reached about half its present length before the end of the Miocene. A strong negative gravity anomaly records a thick sediment basin fill: {\textgreater} 5 km under half its length, reaching a maximum of ≥ 10 km. The fill includes a few km of salt (ca. 6-4 Ma) which forms several diapirs. At any one time large parts of the basin subsided simultaneously, but the site of fastest subsidence seems to have shifted northward. Sedimentation rates reached at least hundreds of metres per million years or more in the Miocene, and ≥ 1 km/Myr in later periods. The basin structure is dominated by longitudinal faults: intrabasinal faults which delimit the pull-apart and which are the extensions of the major strike-slip faults north and south of the basin, and normal faults which extend along the basin margins. The latter faults express a small component of extension across the basin, whereas the pull-apart resulted from the much larger lateral motion along the basin. In addition, transverse faults divide the pull-apart into several segments with somewhat different histories. The pull-apart grew by becoming longer parallel to the transform motion. At shallow levels this was probably achieved by normal slip on transverse listric faults while the fill between them was little deformed. The crust under the basin was stretched and thinned during basin lengthening, which caused its subsidence. Basin formation was accompanied by uplifting of its flanks by ≥ 1 km. Sparse igneous activity occurred along the basin and its flanks. Its presence suggests a thermal anomaly in the lower lithosphere beneath the basin and adjacent parts of the transform.},

	abstract = {For about four decades, the Dead Sea ({DS}) level and the surrounding water table has been dropping dramatically. At least from the eighties, the direct vicinity of the Lisan Peninsula ({LP}), Jordan, has been facing high rates of subsidence and sinkhole hazards. Between 2000 and 2002, the Arab Potash Company ({APC}) lost two salt evaporation ponds resulting in a loss of \$70 million. In the fertile plain of Ghor al Haditha ({GAH}), three deep and wide bowl-shaped subsidence areas threaten human activities and infrastructures. Over the part of the Lisan Peninsula that emerged before the 1960s, relict fossil sinkholes occurred everywhere, whereas new collapses constantly appear in the southern area only. In this paper, we have integrated 15 years of field observations related to sinkholes and subsidence with interpretation of space borne radar interferometric outputs, aerial photographs and satellite images. This has helped to place hazardous areas in their geological context and to clarify them within the framework of the general tectonic setting of the area.},

	abstract = {The Dead Sea Fault ({DSF}) is an active transform fault linking opening in the Red Sea with collision in the Taurus/Zagros Mountains. Motion is left-lateral and estimated at approximately 5–7 mm/year. The fault is seismically active. The extensional regime combined with the dominant lateral motion along the {DSF} resulted in the formation of a series of deep pull-apart basins. These basins are among the largest and deepest in the world. The crustal structure of the {DSF} and its surroundings played a significant role in the development of the physiography and the architecture of the basins. The subsurface structure of the southern {DSF} has been studied quite intensively by various geophysical methods over the past few decades. This review summarizes the main geophysical findings of the crustal structure under the deep basins along the southern {DSF}, comparing the three deep basins against each other in contexts of various geophysical properties, and discussing their tectonic implications. A simulation of faulting processes along the northern {DSF} and the Levant margin suggested that the formation of the {DSF} could be explained as a result of simultaneous propagation from the north and south. Normally most basins are bordered only on one side by a strand of the {DSF}, leading to their asymmetry. Where asymmetry occurs basins do not extend to great depth. In areas where the deep basins occur, two strands of the {DSF} overlap in an en-echelon pattern. This situation is quite rare along the {DSF}. It is suggested that in these places an isolated block of lithosphere has dropped into the mantle. Simulations of this mechanism indicate that the resulting basin is rhomb-shaped and that with time it grows by the addition of distinct segments to its edges.},

Natural processes are significantly affected by human interference as well as by climate change and tectonic developments over the long term. To get a deep understanding of processes and their interactions, innovative scientific approaches that integrate disciplinary research and education are required. The research project {DESERVE} (Helmholtz Virtual Institute Dead Sea Research Venue) addresses these challenges in an interdisciplinary approach that includes geophysics, hydrology, and meteorology. The project is implemented by a consortium of scientific institutions in neighboring countries of the Dead Sea (Israel, Jordan, Palestine Territories) and participating German Helmholtz Centres ({KIT}, {GFZ}, {UFZ}). A new monitoring network of meteorological, hydrological, and seismic/geodynamic stations has been established, and extensive field research and numerical simulations have been undertaken. For the first time, innovative measurement and modeling techniques have been applied to the extreme conditions of the Dead Sea and its surroundings. The preliminary results show the potential of these methods. First time ever performed eddy covariance measurements give insight into the governing factors of Dead Sea evaporation. High-resolution bathymetric investigations reveal a strong correlation between submarine springs and neo-tectonic patterns. Based on detailed studies of stratigraphy and borehole information, the extension of the subsurface drainage basin of the Dead Sea is now reliably estimated. Originality has been achieved in monitoring flash floods in an arid basin at its outlet and simultaneously in tributaries, supplemented by spatio-temporal rainfall data. Low-altitude, high resolution photogrammetry, allied to satellite image analysis and to geophysical surveys (e.g. shear-wave reflections) has enabled a more detailed characterization of sinkhole morphology and temporal development and the possible subsurface controls thereon. All the above listed efforts and scientific results take place with the interdisciplinary education of young scientists. They are invited to attend joint thematic workshops and winter schools as well as to participate in field experiments.},

This paper reviews the research and lake level reconstruction of the late Pleistocene and Holocene lakes in the Dead Sea basin. Lake Lisan and the Dead Sea occupied the Dead Sea basin during the past 70 k.y., and responded to and amplified regional climatological variations in the Eastern Mediterranean. Overall, the lake level history is correlative with global climate patterns. The Lake Lisan high levels correspond to the last Glacial period (marine isotope stages 2–4); its dramatic level drop to the transition to the Holocene, and the Dead Sea low stands to the current interglacial period. The Lisan level record also appears to show relationships to millennial events in Greenland ice and deep-sea cores. The paper describes the methodologies applied to identify indicators of lake level elevations and the determination of their ages. It is divided to (1) the early research history (mainly commencing at the nineteenth century) in the Dead Sea basin; (2) the early efforts of lake level curve reconstructions; and (3) the most recent studies that yield well-dated, high resolution lake level chronologies.},

	abstract = {The continuous redistribution of water involved in the hydrologic cycle leads to deformation of the solid Earth. On a global scale, this deformation is well explained by the loading imposed by hydrological mass variations and can be quantified to first order with space-based gravimetric and geodetic measurements. At the regional scale, however, aquifer systems also undergo poroelastic deformation in response to groundwater fluctuations. Disentangling these related but distinct 3D deformation fields from geodetic time series is essential to accurately invert for changes in continental water mass, to understand the mechanical response of aquifers to internal pressure changes as well as to correct time series for these known effects. Here, we demonstrate a methodology to accomplish this task by considering the example of the well-instrumented Ozark Plateaus Aquifer System ({OPAS}) in the central United States. We begin by characterizing the most important sources of groundwater level variations in the spatially heterogeneous piezometer dataset using an Independent Component Analysis. Then, to estimate the associated poroelastic displacements, we project geodetic time series corrected for hydrological loading effects onto the dominant groundwater temporal functions. We interpret the extracted displacements in light of analytical solutions and a 2D model relating groundwater level variations to surface displacements. In particular, the relatively low estimates of elastic moduli inferred from the poroelastic displacements and groundwater fluctuations may be indicative of aquifer layers with a high fracture density. Our findings suggest that {OPAS} undergoes significant poroelastic deformation, including highly heterogeneous horizontal poroelastic displacements.},

This seismic sequence occurred in the center of a temporary seismic network deployed around the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret). The network was installed to investigate the regional kinematics of the Dead Sea Fault, which is a major transform fault running N-S for more than 1,000 km. The data allowed us to develop a local velocity model for the Sea of Galilee. We relocated more than 600 earthquakes and calculated 27 focal mechanisms pointing out a complex kinematic setting, possibly controlled by fluids at depth. The seismic sequence developed along a {NNW}-striking direction and it is bounded to the east by the N-striking Dead Sea fault. Hypocenter depths range between 6 and 13 km. Directions of the principal stress tensors suggest a transtentional deformation, in agreement with the overall kinematics of the region. We analyze and discuss our data set to investigate mechanisms that potentially triggered the observed seismic swarm, including exacerbated ground water pumping proposed by previous authors. We suggest that the seismic sequence is driven by the dissipation of the elastic load that accumulated in this region.},

Key achievements of these studies include: the determination of slip rate of the {DSF} across different space and time resolutions, which converges at around 4–5 mm/a, confirmation of the sinistral relative motion between the Arabia Plate and the Sinai Subplate and of thrust motion and normal faulting associated with restraining bends and pull apart grabens respectively, and the verification of historical accounts on several strong earthquakes that were associated with surface ruptures. The comparison between the state-of-the-art slip-rate determinations along the {DSF} and the total motion accommodated by the known historical and instrumental earthquakes shows that current seismicity rates cannot account for the full slip rate. As previously proposed, the short-term rate of seismicity is not necessarily representative of the long-term seismic activity along the {DSF}. Assuming the historical records of the last two millennia are complete for strong earthquakes, we note long periods of quiescence in the sections of the northern Yammouneh, the Jordan Valley, and the southern Araba.},

Residual signals are often present at these scales and are interpreted to be noise of indeterminate origin, limiting studies of long-wavelength deformation. Here, we demonstrate the impact of rigid motion by the Earth's tectonic plates on velocity fields derived from {InSAR}. The range-dependent incidence angle of the {InSAR} observations, coupled with plate velocities of centimeters per year, can induce long-wavelength spatial gradients of millimeters per year over hundreds of kilometers in {InSAR} velocity fields. We show that, after applying corrections, including for the ionosphere and troposphere, plate motion represents the dominant source of long-wavelength secular velocity gradients in multi-year time series for several study areas. This signal can be accounted for using plate motion models, allowing improved detection of regional tectonic strain at continental scales.},

	abstract = {Deformation of the Earth's surface associated with redistributions of continental water mass explains, to first order, the seasonal signals observed in geodetic position time series. Discriminating these seasonal signals from other sources of deformation in geodetic measurements is essential to isolate tectonic signals and to monitor spatio-temporal variations in continental water storage. We propose a new methodology to identify and extract these seasonal signals. The approach uses a variational Bayesian Independent Component Analysis ({vbICA}) to extract the seasonal signals and a gravity-based deformation model to identify which of these signals are caused by surface loading. We test the procedure on two study areas, the Arabian Peninsula and the Nepal Himalaya, and find that the technique successfully extracts the seasonal signals with one or two independent components, depending on whether the load is stationary or moving. The approach is robust to spatial heterogeneities inherent to geodetic measurements and can help extract systematic errors in geodetic products (e.g., draconitic errors). We also discuss how to handle the degree-1 deformation field present in the geodetic data set but not captured by the gravity-based model.},

As they are not observable by {GRACE}, we use at first the degree-1 spherical harmonic coefficients from Swenson et al. (2008, https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JB005338). We compare the predicted displacements with the position time series of 689 globally distributed continuous Global Navigation Satellite System ({GNSS}) stations. While {GNSS} vertical displacements are well explained by the model at a global scale, horizontal displacements are systematically underpredicted and out of phase with {GNSS} station position time series. We then reestimate the degree 1 deformation field from a comparison between our {GRACE}-derived model, with no a priori degree 1 loads, and the {GNSS} observations. We show that this approach reconciles {GRACE}-derived loading displacements and {GNSS} station position time series at a global scale, particularly in the horizontal components. Assuming that they reflect surface loading deformation only, our degree-1 estimates can be translated into geocenter motion time series. We also address and assess the impact of systematic errors in {GNSS} station position time series at the Global Positioning System ({GPS}) draconitic period and its harmonics on the comparison between {GNSS} and {GRACE}-derived annual displacements. Our results confirm that surface mass redistributions observed by {GRACE}, combined with an elastic spherical and layered Earth model, can be used to provide first-order corrections for loading deformation observed in both horizontal and vertical components of {GNSS} station position time series.},

In this thesis, we investigate some of these interactions by harnessing recent developments in the fields of satellite geodesy, statistical data analysis and elastodynamic earthquake modelling. We start by developing a procedure to identify and extract seasonal deformation signals associated with hydrological loading of the solid Earth from geodetic time series in Chapter 1. In Chapters 2 and 3, we consider the examples of the Ozarks Plateau (central United States) and Sacramento Valley (California) to establish a methodology for characterizing poroelastic deformation arising from groundwater variations with space-based geodesy. Then, in Chapter 4, we develop a model to simulate fault slip due to crustal water injections and calibrate it against a well-instrumented field experiment on a natural fault. We conclude by deriving a theoretical understanding of these fault slip simulations by considering the simple case of a fixed-length pressurized zone in Chapter 5. Overall, our work provides key insights for extracting and using different sources of hydrogeodetic signals as well as for modeling and understanding fluid-induced fault slip processes, which is becoming increasingly important in a world faced with water scarcity, a changing climate and an increased reliance on groundwater and geoenergy resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It provides the French {ForM}@ter scientific community with automatically processed products using a state of the art processing chain based on a small baseline subset approach, namely the New Small Baseline ({NSBAS}). The service results from a collaboration between the scientific team that develops and maintains the {NSBAS} processing chain and the French Spatial Agency ({CNES}) that mirrors the Sentinel-1 data. The proximity to Sentinel-1 data, the {NSBAS} workflow, and the specific optimizations to make {NSBAS} processing massively parallel for the {CNES} high performance computing infrastructure ensures the efficiency of the chain, especially in terms of input and output, which is the key for the success of such a service. The {FLATSIM} service is made of a production module, a delivery module and a user access module. Products include interferograms, surface line of sight velocity, phase delay time series and auxiliary data. Numerous quality indicators are provided for an in-depth analysis of the quality and limits of the results. The first national call in 2020 for region of interest ended up with 8 regions spread over the world with scientific interests, including seismology, tectonics, volcano-tectonics, and hydrological cycle.

	abstract = {Despite significant recent advancements, global hydrological models and their input databases still show limited capabilities in supporting many spatially detailed research questions and integrated assessments, such as required in freshwater ecology or applied water resources management. In order to address these challenges, the scientific community needs to create improved large-scale datasets and more flexible data structures that enable the integration of information across and within spatial scales; develop new and advanced models that support the assessment of longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity; and provide an accessible modeling environment for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. As a contribution, we here present a new modeling framework that integrates hydrographic baseline data at a global scale (enhanced {HydroSHEDS} layers and coupled datasets) with new modeling tools, specifically a river network routing model ({HydroROUT}) that is currently under development. The resulting ‘hydro-spatial fabric’ is designed to provide an avenue for advanced hydro-ecological applications at large scales in a consistent and highly versatile way. Preliminary results from case studies to assess human impacts on water quality and the effects of dams on river fragmentation and downstream flow regulation illustrate the potential of this combined data-and-modeling framework to conduct novel research in the fields of aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, geo-statistical modeling, or pollution and health risk assessments. The global scale outcomes are at a previously unachieved spatial resolution of 500 m and can thus support local planning and decision making in many of the world's large river basins.

	abstract = {The Dead Sea water-level has been dropping at an exceedingly increasing rate since 1960, and between 1993 and 2001, the interval of the {InSAR} data examined in this study, it has dropped at an average rate of 0.88 m per year. Such a water-level change could potentially give rise to a resolvable lithospheric rebound and regional uplift, with spatial extent and amplitude that are controlled by the effective mechanical properties of the crust and upper mantle combined. We measure that deformation for the years 1993 to 2001, using 149 short baseline interferograms made of 31 {ERS}-1 and {ERS}-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar ({SAR}) images and continuous {GPS} data from the Survey of Israel recorded between 1997 and 2011. The uplift rate at the Dead Sea is small (up to 4 mm/year), and the basin topography is almost a mirror of the displacement, introducing a strong trade-off between uplift and stratified atmosphere noise. To overcome this complication, we impose a linearity constraint on the satellite to ground Line Of Sight ({LOS}) phase changes based on the steady uplift observed by a continuous {GPS} station in the area of interest, and simultaneously solve for the {LOS} change rate, Digital Elevation Model ({DEM}) errors and the elevation-phase correlation. While the {LOS} rate and {DEM} errors are solved for each pixel independently, the elevation-phase correlation is solved for each {SAR} acquisition independently. Using this approach we separated the stratified atmospheric delay from the ground displacement. We observed a regional uplift around the Dead Sea northern basin, with maximum uplift close to the shorelines, and diminishing to zero by the Mediterranean coast. We modeled the effect of water load changes using a homogeneous elastic half-space, and found a good agreement between modeled and observed ground displacements using elastic properties that are compatible with seismic and gravity data down to a depth of 15 km below the Dead Sea basin, suggesting that the response of the crust to the sea level drop is controlled mainly by the elastic properties of the upper-crust immediately below the Dead Sea basin.},

	abstract = {We measure ground motion around the Lake Mead, Nevada, using synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The lake water level has fluctuated through time since impoundment in 1935. To quantify the deformation due to water level variations over the past decade, and to constrain the crust and mantle rheological parameters in the lake area, we analyze 241 interferograms based on 43 {ERS} images acquired between 1992 and 2002. All interferograms have a high coherence due to arid conditions. Most of them show strong atmospheric artefacts. Tropospheric phase delays are estimated and corrected for each interferogram by analyzing the phase/elevation correlation. Corrections are validated using data from the {ERA}40 global atmospheric reanalysis. Corrected interferograms are inverted pixel by pixel to solve for the time series of ground motion in the lake area. Temporal smoothing is added to reduce random atmospheric artefacts. The observed deformation is nonlinear in time and spreads over a 50 × 50 km2 area. We observe a 16 mm subsidence between 1995 and 1998 due to an 11 m water level increase, followed by an uplift due to the water level drop after 2000. We model the deformation, taking into account the loading history of the lake since 1935. A simple elastic model with parameters constrained by seismic wave velocities does not explain the amplitude of the observed motion. The two-layer viscoelastic model proposed by Kaufmann and Amelung (2000), with a mantle viscosity of 1018 Pa s, adjusts well the data amplitude and its spatiotemporal shape.},
